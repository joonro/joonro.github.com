<p>My main research interest is evaluating the effectiveness of firms’ marketing
strategies in the setting where dynamic components such as forward-looking
consumers, secondary market, and network effects are important. I found it
fascinating how these factors can significantly alter the effectiveness of the
marketing strategies, and failure to take these into account often leads to
wrong policy implications.</p>
<p>I study these issues by applying empirical industrial organization models to
marketing; I employ structural models and conduct counterfactual analysis to
evaluate marketing and economic policies. I enjoy tackling computationally
challenging problems and implementing efficient algorithms.  I am passionate
about reproducible science, and I have released a couple of scientific
libraries that I have developed for my projects as open source software
packages.</p>
<p>For example,
.. begin-essay-1
I develop a dynamic structural model of durable goods,
incorporating both demand and supply side under the presence of used goods
market in the first essay of my dissertation. This model incorporates firm&#8217;s
optimal intertemporal pricing, forward-looking consumers, and their
interaction with the secondary market. By exploiting firm&#8217;s optimal policy,
this model can recover demand parameters by only using prices, without
observing sales information. I apply this model to video games industry, and
estimate game-specific demand. With estimated parameters, I evaluate several
marketing and economic policies by counterfactual analysis, notably the
evaluation of the profit after elimination of the secondary market.</p>
<p>In the subsequent essay,
.. begin-essay-2
I consider additional marketing strategy of
post-release add-on. Many producers in the video game industry releases
add-ons called downloadable contents (DLC). The idea of this paper is that
this add-on can be an effective strategy to reduce the competition from the
used goods market. This is because in order to play the DLC, a consumer must
have the original copy of the game. Hence, if consumers expect future release
of the add-ons, ones who want to play the DLC will hold on to their disc
instead of selling them, effectively reducing the used copy supply.  I plan to
extend the model of the first essay and add the release of DLC as another
control variable. Counterfactual analysis will shed light on the profit
implications and optimal release timing of the DLC.</p>
<p>In another project work in progress, I estimate aggregate dynamic demand with
random coefficient model to quantify the welfare and profit implications of
bilateral free trade agreement. Recently South Korea has negotiated a couple
of major bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs), with EU and the U.S, which
have come into force in 2011 and 2012, respectively.  Since there are
significant time gap between the announcement of an agreement and the actual
date when the agreement enters into effect, durable goods consumers may
postpone purchase, expecting future price decline due to the agreement. Thus
modeling dynamics is important in the welfare and profit calculation.
Utilizing unique, hand-collected automotive characteristics information and
aggregate level sales data, I plan to estimate dynamic new durable goods
demand model and conduct counterfactual analyses with different levels of
tariffs. This will shed light on the durable goods industry dynamics due to
competition environment change.</p>
<p>The policy change of FTAs will also give me an opportunity to study
multi-product firms&#8217; product introduction decision. There have been
significant entries of new models in the Korean automotive market after the
FTAs&#8217;. This will provide information about supply side policy and I plan to
estimate oblivious equilibrium model of imperfect competition.</p>
<p>As a researcher, I am committed to application of rigorous methodology to
relevant problems.  By studying the effectiveness of marketing policies under
different market environments I aim to provide both managerial implications
and policy recommendations. I believe an empirical researcher&#8217;s ability to
accommodate more realistic models and the range of questions he can address
critically depend on his proficiency in computation, and I look to improve my
skills continuously. As a Marketing researcher, I strive to work on issues
that has significant substantial and methodological contributions.</p>
