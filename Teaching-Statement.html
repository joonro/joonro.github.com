<p>My teaching interests include Principles of Marketing, Marketing Research,
Pricing, and Data Mining. I have taught an undergraduate course (the
Principles of Marketing) and was nominated for Fred Moore Assistant Instructor
Awards for Teaching Excellence. In addition, I have been working as teaching
assistant for various undergraduate courses as well as an PhD course.</p>
<p>I believe it is very important to highlight the relevance of the class for
students&#8217; motivation to learn. First, I have clear objectives for the class
listed on the syllabus. Also, I explain the position of the class in the
relation to other classes (i.e., what are the subsequent classes they could
take and how taking this class will help them in those classes).  The
relevance of each topic will also be made clear by highlighting the position
of the topic in the big picture of the whole course.  In addition, I describe
how specific course content can be applied in their potential future
occupations. Another way of showing students the relevance of the class is
through guest speakers. I generally include 2-3 guest speaker sessions during
a semester, where people from industry describe their jobs and show how the
marketing knowledge we learn during the class is being applied in the real
world.</p>
<p>I emphasize applications of the course content. First, I have frequent, small
in-class exercises. These are often group exercises, and students are asked to
apply concepts they learned during the class to a small but real-world
problem, which are usually introduced through business articles from business
periodicals such as <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Financial Times</em>. This is meant
to remind them of the applicability of the subject.  Also, I require an end of
semester group project. Through the in-class exercises students practice
applying one concept. The group project builds on this work as they practice
integrating what they have learned throughout the course into one project.</p>
<p>I try to distill the knowledge and organize the material in a way that
students could see the structure of the knowledge. In addition, I try to
incorporate various multimedia (e.g., commercial videos which show promotion
strategies; audio clips from radio business programs which describe new
business opportunities) into the class. Students have different learning
styles, and it will enhances their learning since they will be exposed
presentation of ideas in different formats. This also ensures repeated
exposure to concepts and helps keeping them engaged during class sessions.</p>
