<h1>Research and Dissertation<a class="headerlink" href="#research-and-dissertation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>My main research interest is evaluating the effectiveness of firms&#8217; marketing
strategies in settings where dynamic components such as forward-looking
consumers, secondary market, and network effects are important. I am
fascinated by how these factors can significantly alter the effectiveness of
marketing strategies, and how failure to take these factors into account can
lead to suboptimal, or even erroneous policy implications. Specifically, I
apply empirical industrial organization models to marketing; I employ
structural models and conduct counterfactual analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of marketing and economic policies.</p>

<h2>Essay 1: A Dynamic Equilibrium Model of Durable Goods: Pricing and Resale Market Strategies for Video Games<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-1-a-dynamic-equilibrium-model-of-durable-goods-pricing-and-resale-market-strategies-for-video-games" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the first essay of my dissertation, I study how the used goods market
affects market outcomes and the implications of eliminating it in the video
game industry. I develop a general modeling framework that incorporates
rational expectations on new and used goods prices, inter-temporal pricing
discrimination, and a competitive used goods market. The demand function is
constructed from heterogeneous consumers modeled by a distribution of their
valuation on a Hotelling line, which enables us to estimate sales volume
shares over time from the varying decreasing rates of new and used goods
prices without the need of observing real sales data. The equilibrium prices
and sales for both new and used game markets are solved explicitly assuming
that the observed new game prices are set optimally by firms and the used game
prices clear a competitive used goods market. A producer’s inter-temporal
pricing strategy is determined not only for price discrimination, but also
from considering competition with the resale market. Using this model, we
estimate game specific demand with hand-collected prices data. Counterfactual
analysis suggests the used game market harms most games in terms of
profitability, but can still benefit a smaller number of games, depending on
the consumer valuation distribution and expected playtime.</p>

<h2>Essay 2. A Model of Downloadable Contents<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-2-a-model-of-downloadable-contents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a subsequent essay, I extend my model to examine the implications of an
additional marketing strategy, post-release add-ons.  Many video game
producers release add-ons called downloadable contents (DLC) for a relatively
low price, which extends playing time of their video games.
This can be an effective strategy to reduce competition from the used goods
market. This is because in order to play the DLC, a consumer must physically
have the original copy of the game; hence, forward-looking consumers who
anticipate that a DLC will be released in the near future will likely to hold on
to their disc rather than selling them, effectively reducing the used copy supply
in the market. Counterfactual analysis will shed light on profit implications
and optimal release-timing of the DLC.</p>
