<h1>Research and Dissertation<a class="headerlink" href="#research-and-dissertation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I use empirical models to evaluate the
effectiveness of marketing strategies in various settings such as durable
goods and entertainment consumption.  I am especially interested in dynamic
components such as forward-looking consumers, secondary markets, WOM, and
network effects.  I am fascinated by how these factors significantly alter
the effectiveness of marketing strategies, and how failing to take these
factors into account can lead to suboptimal, or even erroneous policy
implications. I use both individual and aggregate level data
to analyze agents&#8217; behavior and make policy recommendations.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am also interested in marketing analytics
and modeling consumer behavior. I have ideal quantitative and computational
skillsets to be a successful researcher in analytics using big data, and I
have ample experience in gathering and processing large amount of data.</p>

<h2>Essay 1: Pricing and Resale Market Strategy for Durable
Goods: A Dynamic Equilibrium Model of Video Games<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-1-essay1-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I develop a dynamic structural model to
quantify the impact of the used goods market on pricing and profits in the
video game industry and study the managerial implications of resale
restrictions. My model incorporates forward-looking consumers,
intertemporal price discrimination, and the used goods market. To solve the
challenge of lacking used goods transaction data, I explicitly incorporate
the supply side in the estimation and infer sales volume from the observed
prices and equilibrium conditions. Using a unique dataset I collected from
the web, I found that the profit gains from prohibiting resale largely
depends on the shape of the game&#8217;s demand distribution, suggesting
game-specific optimal strategies regarding prohibiting the used game
market.</p>

<h2>Essay 2. A Model of Downloadable Contents: Add-On and the
Used Goods Market<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-2-essay2-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I extend the model in my first dissertation
essay to examine the implications of an additional marketing strategy,
i.e., post-release add-ons. Many video game producers release add-ons
called downloadable contents (DLC) for a relatively low price, which extend
consumers&#8217; video game-playing time. This can be an effective strategy to
delay consumers&#8217; used goods resale which would in turn reduce competition
from the used goods market. This is because, to play the DLC, a consumer
must physically have the original copy of the game; forward-looking
consumers who anticipate that DLC will be released in the near future
will likely to hold on to their disc rather than selling them, effectively
reducing the used copy supply. Counterfactual analysis will shed light on
how much profit can be gained with this marketing strategy and the optimal
timing of DLC release.</p>

<h2>Essay 3. Variety Seeking in Experiential Consumption:
Evidence from the Movie Industry<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-3-essay3-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Compared to typical consumer packaged goods, a
number of experiential product categories such as films, books, video
games, and even vacation packages are characterized by single consumption
episodes; consumers generally do not consume the same product multiple
times, let alone consecutively. When it is natural for consumers to choose
a different product for every consumption episode, is there any state
dependence, and if so how can we capture it? The current literature lacks a
framework that can understand and measure consumer state dependence or
variety seeking in these settings.  We add to the literature by using an
attribute-based approach and creating a genre similarity index to capture
state dependence. Measuring state dependence in experiential goods is
particularly interesting because of two competing forces at play, making
the prediction less clear. The single consumption nature implies greater
uncertainty and perceived risk in each consumption decision, and it can
promote state dependence; however, prior research suggests consumers want
variety for hedonic consumption. Further, we examine the role of online
product ratings in alleviating uncertainty associated with less familiar
movie genres, and consequently reducing genre state dependence.  We use a
unique individual-level dataset of theater movie watching, which has
information about specific dates and times of consumption. Hence it allows
us to observe actual (vs. planned) consumption behavior. We estimate a
choice model which incorporates state dependence, persistent consumer
preferences, and the impact of movie ratings.  We find that consumers
choose different genres when watching multiple movies a day; but this
variety-seeking behavior is significantly reduced just one day past their
previous consumption, meaning consumers tend to watch similar genres
repeatedly.  Further, we find that positive movie ratings provided by other
consumers can reduce this inertia, as the impact of positive ratings are
more prominent when the subsequent genre is different from the previously
watched one. These findings provide useful insights for managers,
especially when making recommendations for experiential products based on
consumers’ purchase history.</p>
