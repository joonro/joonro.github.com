<h1>Research and Dissertation<a class="headerlink" href="#research-and-dissertation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>My main research interests are structural
modeling and marketing analysis. First, I evaluate the effectiveness of
firms&#8217; marketing strategies in settings where dynamic components such as
forward-looking consumers, secondary markets, and network effects are
important.  I am fascinated by how these factors significantly alter the
effectiveness of marketing strategies, and how failing to take these
factors into account can lead to suboptimal, or even erroneous policy
implications. I employ structural models and conduct
counterfactual analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing and
economic policies.</p>

<h2>Essay 1: Pricing and Resale Market Strategy for Durable
Goods: A Dynamic Equilibrium Model of the Video Game Market<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-1-essay1-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I develop a dynamic structural model to
quantify the impact of the used goods market on pricing and profits in the
video game industry and study the managerial implications of resale
restrictions. My model incorporates forward-looking consumers,
intertemporal price discrimination, and the used goods market. To solve the
challenge of lacking the used goods market transaction data, I explicitly
incorporate the supply side in the estimation and infer sales volume from
the observed prices and equilibrium conditions. Using a unique dataset I
collected from the web, I found that the profit gains from prohibiting
resale largely depends on the shape of the game&#8217;s demand distribution,
suggesting game-specific optimal strategies regarding prohibiting the used
game market.</p>

<h2>Essay 2. A Model of Downloadable Contents: Add-on and the
Used Goods Market<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-2-essay2-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I extend the model in my first dissertation
essay to examine the implications of an additional marketing strategy,
i.e., post-release add-ons. Many video game producers release add-ons
called downloadable contents (DLC) for a relatively low price, which extend
consumers&#8217; video game-playing time. This can be an effective strategy to
delay consumers&#8217; used goods resale which would in turn reduce competition
from the used goods market. This is because, to play the DLC, a consumer
must physically have the original copy of the game; forward-looking
consumers who anticipate that DLC will be released in the near future
will likely to hold on to their disc rather than selling them, effectively
reducing the used copy supply. Counterfactual analysis will shed light on
how much profit can be gained with this marketing strategy and the optimal
timing of DLC release.</p>

<h2>Essay 3. Variety Seeking in Hedonic Goods Consumption:
Evidence from the Movie Theater Industry<a class="headerlink" href="#essay-3-essay3-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We study consumers&#8217; variety seeking in hedonic
goods consumption and the impact of consumer ratings in the context of
movie choice. While consumers are expected to engage in variety-seeking
when consuming hedonic goods, uncertainty about product quality may
mitigate this tendency. Exposure to online ratings information is likely to
alleviate this uncertainty, and could facilitate more variety-seeking
behavior. Using a unique, individual-level dataset of movie-going, we
estimate a choice model which incorporates state dependence, persistent
consumer preferences, and the impact of consumer ratings.  We find that
consumers are likely to seek variety in movie genres when watching multiple
movies a day. However, after just a day since the previous movie-watching,
consumers start to display positive state-dependence in their choice of
genres, meaning they tend to watch similar genres again. This suggests that
inertia is a general behavioral phenomenon rather than a unique
characteristic of shopping for more utilitarian consumer packaged goods.
Importantly, we find that positive movie ratings provided by other
consumers can overcome the inertia, as the impact of positive ratings are
more prominent when the genre of the subsequent movie differs from the that
of the previously viewed one.</p>
