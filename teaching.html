<h1>Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>My teaching interests include Marketing Management,
Marketing Research,
Marketing Analytics,
and Digital Marketing.  I have taught an
undergraduate course (Principles of Marketing) and was nominated for Fred
Moore Assistant Instructor Awards for Teaching Excellence with average
evaluation 4.0/5.0. To advance my teaching abilities, I took a graduate
teaching scholars seminar and participated in a teaching study group hosted by
Software Carpentry. In addition, I have been working as teaching assistant for
various undergraduate courses (Principles of Marketing, Marketing Information
and Analysis) as well as a PhD course (Bayesian Econometrics).</p>
<p>I want my students to find my course useful in their future endeavors, making
a long-term impact in their career. Specifically, I want my students to
understand how their learned skills can be applied in the real-world and to be
able to teach themselves when needed, and become life-long, self-regulated
learners. Thus I emphasize increasing relevance, applicability, and
digestibility in teaching.</p>
<div class="section" id="relevance">
<h2>1.  Relevance<a class="headerlink" href="#relevance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I believe it is important to highlight the relevance of the class to enhance
students&#8217; motivation to learn. Thus, I have clear and concrete objectives for
the class in the syllabus. Second, I explain the position of the class in
relation to other classes (i.e., what the subsequent classes they could take
are and how taking this class will help them in those). Third, the importance
of each topic or chapter is made clear by highlighting its role in the big
picture of the entire course. Fourth, I describe how specific course content
can be applied in their potential future occupations. Finally, I invite guest
speakers to show students the relevance of the class; during a semester I
generally invite 2-3 guest speakers who are currently active in the industry,
so they can talk about and answer students’ questions related to how the
marketing knowledge learned in class is being applied in the real world .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application">
<h2>2.  Application<a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I emphasize applications of course content. First, I frequently engage
students in exercises. These are typically group activities, and students are
asked to apply concepts they learned during the class to a small but
real-world problem; the problems are usually introduced through business
articles from business periodicals such as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and
<em>Financial Times</em>. This is meant to remind students of the applicability of
the learned subject. Also, I require an end-of-semester group project. Through
the in-class exercises students practice applying one concept; the final group
project builds on this work as they practice integrating what they have
learned throughout the course more comprehensively, and in a larger scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digestibility">
<h2>3.  Digestibility<a class="headerlink" href="#digestibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I try to distill the concepts and organize class materials in ways that
students could clearly see the structure of the knowledge being delivered. For
example, each class starts with review of the materials we learn from the last
session and then the intro of the current one. The class ends with summary of
the materials just covered, emphasizing how the current topic is connected to
other topics and its place in the long-term goals of the class. In addition, I
try to incorporate various multimedia (e.g., commercial videos for various
promotion strategies, audio clips from radio business programs describing new
business opportunities) into the class. Students have different learning
styles, and exposure to several formats of learning materials can enhance the
teaching effectiveness. This also ensures repeated exposure to concepts and
helps keeping students engaged during class.</p>
<p>My teaching philosophies and strategies summarized above reflect my belief
about how individuals learn. I believe that students make the most out of a
course when they are motivated, can practice application, and are able to
comprehend materials fluently. Through continuously incorporating students’
and colleagues’ feedback, I believe my teaching effectiveness will only grow
as I teach.</p>
