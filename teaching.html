<h1>Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>My teaching interests include Marketing Research,
Marketing Analytics,
and
Digital Marketing
along with other core courses.  I have taught an
undergraduate course (Principles of Marketing) and was nominated for
<em>Fred Moore Assistant Instructor Awards for Teaching
Excellence</em> with average evaluation 4.0/5.0. To advance my teaching
abilities, I took a <em>graduate teaching scholars seminar</em> and participated in a
teaching study group hosted by Software Carpentry. In addition, I have worked
as a teaching assistant for various undergraduate courses (Principles of
Marketing, Marketing Information and Analysis) as well as a PhD course
(Bayesian Econometrics). Also, I will be a teaching assistant for a master&#8217;s
level Marketing Analytics course next semester, one of the electives of
McCombs&#8217; Business Analytics program. I volunteered for this position to
better prepare myself to teach an analytics course.</p>
<p>I want to provide engaging learning experiences to students through
teaching. Furthermore, I want to make a long-term impact in their career by
ensuring to deliver relevant materials and also taking extra attention in
their development.  Specifically, I want my students to understand how the
materials they learned during classes can be applied in the real-world and to
be able to teach themselves when needed, and to become life-long,
self-regulated learners. I emphasize relevance, digestibility, applicability,
and development in teaching.</p>
<div class="section" id="relevance">
<h2>Relevance<a class="headerlink" href="#relevance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is important to highlight the relevance of a class to enhance students&#8217;
motivation to learn. Thus, I have clear and concrete objectives of the course
in the syllabus. Second, I explain the position of the class in relation to
other classes (i.e., what the subsequent classes they could take are and how
taking this class will help them in those). Third, the importance of each
topic or chapter is made clear by highlighting its role in the big picture of
the entire course. Fourth, I describe how specific course content can be
applied in their potential future occupations. Finally, I invite guest
speakers to show students the relevance of the class; during a semester I
generally invite 2-3 guest speakers who are currently active in a relevant
industry, so they can share their experiences and answer students’ questions
about how the marketing knowledge learned in classes is being applied in the
real world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digestibility">
<h2>Digestibility<a class="headerlink" href="#digestibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I try to distill the concepts and organize class materials in ways that
students could clearly see the structure of the knowledge being delivered. For
example, each class starts with review of the materials we learn from the last
session and then the intro of the current one. The class ends with summary of
the materials just covered, emphasizing how the current topic is connected to
other topics and its place in the long-term goals of the class. In addition, I
try to incorporate various multimedia (e.g., commercial videos for various
promotion strategies, audio clips from radio business programs describing new
business opportunities) into the class. Students have different learning
styles, and exposure to several formats of learning materials can enhance the
teaching effectiveness. This also ensures repeated exposure to concepts and
helps keeping students engaged during classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application">
<h2>Application<a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I emphasize applications of course content. First, I frequently engage
students in exercises. These are typically group activities, and students are
asked to apply concepts they learned during the class to a small but
real-world problem; the problems are usually introduced through business
articles from business periodicals such as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and
<em>Financial Times</em>. This is meant to remind students of the applicability of
the learned subject. Also, I require an end-of-semester group project. Through
the in-class exercises students practice applying one concept; the final group
project builds on this work as they practice integrating what they have
learned throughout the course more comprehensively, and in a larger scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="development">
<h2>Development<a class="headerlink" href="#development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I emphasize development in both students&#8217; learning and my teaching skills.  I
enjoy advising and interacting with students, and I thrive to improve my
teaching through incorporating students&#8217; feedback. Students will be more
motivated and persistent in learning when the teacher shows interest in their
individual development and opinions. Also, I am interested in developing new
teaching methods using new technologies, and my superior computer-related
skills will certainly facilitate this.</p>
<p>My teaching philosophies and strategies summarized above reflect my belief
about how individuals learn. I believe that students make the most out of a
course when they are motivated, can practice application, and are able to
comprehend materials fluently. Through continuously incorporating students’
and colleagues’ feedback, I believe my teaching effectiveness will only grow
as I teach.</p>
