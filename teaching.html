<h1>Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>My teaching interests include Marketing Research,
Marketing Analytics,
and
Digital Marketing
along with other core courses. I have taught an
undergraduate course (Principles of Marketing) and was nominated for the
<em>Fred Moore Assistant Instructor Awards for Teaching
Excellence</em> with an average evaluation of 4.0/5.0. To advance my
teaching abilities, I took the <em>graduate teaching scholars seminar</em> and
participated in instructor training hosted by Software Carpentry. In addition,
I have worked as a teaching assistant for various undergraduate courses
(Principles of Marketing, Marketing Information and Analysis) as well as a PhD
course (Bayesian Econometrics). Also, I will be a teaching assistant for a
master&#8217;s level Marketing Analytics course next semester, one of the electives
of McCombs&#8217; Business Analytics program. I volunteered for this position to
better prepare myself to teach an analytics course.</p>
<p>I want to provide engaging learning experiences to students through
teaching. Furthermore, I want to make a long-term impact in their career by
delivering relevant materials and also paying careful attention to their
development.  Specifically, I help my students understand how the materials
they learned in class can be applied in the real-world and learn how to teach
themselves when needed o they can become life-long, self-regulated
learners. For this I emphasize relevance, digestibility, applicability, and
development in teaching.</p>
<div class="section" id="relevance">
<h2>Relevance<a class="headerlink" href="#relevance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is important to highlight the relevance of a class to enhance students&#8217;
motivation to learn. Thus, I have clear and concrete objectives of the course
in the syllabus. Second, I explain the position of the class in relation to
other classes (i.e., i.e., how my course opens up opportunities to take other
relevant courses). Third, the importance of each topic or chapter is made
clear by highlighting its role in the big picture of the entire
course. Fourth, I describe how specific course content can be applied in their
potential future occupations. Finally, I invite guest speakers to show
students the relevance of the class; during a semester I generally invite 2-3
guest speakers who are currently active in a related industry, so the speakers
can share their experiences and answer students’ questions about how the
marketing knowledge learned in classes can be translated into the real world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digestibility">
<h2>Digestibility<a class="headerlink" href="#digestibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I try to distill the concepts and organize class materials in ways that allow
students to clearly see the structure of the knowledge being delivered. For
example, each class session starts with a review of the previous session which
then transitions into the intro of the current one. The class ends with
summary of materials covered in it, emphasizing how they are connected to
other topics and help with the achievement of long-term goals of the entire
course. In addition, I try to incorporate various multimedia (e.g., videos
illustrating various promotion strategies, audio clips from radio business
programs describing new business opportunities) into the class. Students have
different learning styles, and introducing various formats of learning
materials can enhance the teaching effectiveness. This also ensures repeated
exposure to concepts and keeps students engaged during classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application">
<h2>Application<a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I emphasize applications of course content. First, I frequently engage
students in exercises. These are typically group activities, where students
apply concepts they learned during the class to a small but concrete
real-world problem; the problems are usually introduced through business
articles from periodicals such as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Financial
Times</em>. This is meant to remind students of the applicability of the learned
subject. Also, I require an end-of-semester group project. Through the
in-class exercises students practice applying one concept; the final group
project builds on this work as they practice integrating what they have
learned throughout the course more comprehensively, and in a larger scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="development">
<h2>Development<a class="headerlink" href="#development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I emphasize development in both students&#8217; learning and my teaching skills.
Students will be more motivated and persistent in learning when the teacher
shows interest in their individual development and opinions. I enjoy advising
and interacting with students. Moreover, I thrive to improve my teaching
through incorporating their feedback. I am also interested in developing new
teaching methods using up-to-date technologies, and my superior
computer-related skills will certainly facilitate this. For example, for
statistics course, I use</p>
<p>My teaching philosophies and strategies summarized above reflect my belief
about how individuals learn. I believe that students make the most out of a
course when they are motivated, can practice application, and are able to
comprehend materials fluently. Through continuously incorporating students’
and colleagues’ feedback, I believe my teaching effectiveness will only grow
as I teach.</p>
